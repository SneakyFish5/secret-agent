# Session

> A Session tracks a single "scraping" session. They track and coordinate the [HumanEmulator](./human-emulators), [BrowserEmulator](./browser-emulators) and [SecretAgent](../basic-interfaces/agent) that will be used.

Sessions store data into a Sqlite database using a module called SessionState. This database tracks all the information needed to recreate a session in [SessionReplay](./session-replay)
